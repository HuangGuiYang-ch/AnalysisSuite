This directory already contains the perl scripts from scripts.zip
You may want to add registration binaries for your operating system.

Although the R scripts do not need this, you may wish to add the directory to your path if you want to use the tools from the command line.

For bash (default on osx 10.3)

Edit your ~/.profile or ~/.bashrc to add:

PATH="${PATH}:/path/to/Registration/folder/bin"
export PATH

Check that the path has been set by starting a new command line session and typing:

echo $PATH

You can also put the contents somewhere else sensible like /usr/local/bin or ~/bin
